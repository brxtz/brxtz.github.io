    <h2>Hey! My name is Rafael, and this is my website. Welcome!</h2>
    <p>Using a variety of interesting projects, my HTML and CSS portfolio website serves as a lively 
        demonstration of my broad range of technical abilities.<br/> This website serves as a casual, 
        friendly platform for me to display my proficiency in web development and my larger 
        technology skills. My major objective is to pique the interest of other tech lovers and 
        employers and partners by highlighting my capacity to handle challenging problems and 
        provide workable answers. <br/>The website is easy to use, responsive across all platforms, and 
        a true representation of the work I put into every project. It is a dynamic representation of 
        my journey and goals in the tech industry, not just a creative tool!</p>
