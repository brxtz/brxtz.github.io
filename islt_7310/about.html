        <div>
            <p>Hello! As I mentioned on the landing page, my name is <em>Rafael</em>, and I am pursuing a
                bachelor’s degree of science in <em>information technology</em> at the <strong>University of Missouri</strong>. I
                expect to graduate in December 2024, and I plan to become a cybersecurity expert or
                software developer with my degree. On the more casual side, I am from Brazil and some of
                my hobbies are reading, playing video games, exercising, hanging out with my friends, and
                watching movies and TV shows.<br/> Here is one of my favorite quotes from a good science fiction
                book:</p>
